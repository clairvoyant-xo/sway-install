# Simple install script for installing Arch Linux with Sway WM
This is meant to be run when installing the system for the first time. It'll install an AUR helper (paru), AMD drivers (mesa), audio drivers (pipewire) and my own version of Sway WM with its corresponding dotfiles. It will not install a session manager, as it'll launch the WM automatically on login through tty1.
